				<h2>history</h2>
				<p>
					The city of Jaipur was founded by King of Amer, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh Il on 18 November 1727, who
                    ruled from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amer, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to
accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water. [121 Jai Singh consulted several
books on architecture and architects while planning the layout of Jaipur. Under the architectural guidance of
Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur was planned based on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa
Shastra.[15] The construction of the city began in 1726 and took four years to complete the major roads,
offices, and palaces. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which contained the state buildings and
palaces, with the remaining seven allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built, pierced by seven fortified
gates.

				<h2>climate</h2>
				<p>
					Jaipur has a monsoon-influenced hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh) with long, extremely hot summers and short, mild to
					warm winters. Annual precipitation is over 63 cm, falling mostly in July and August due to monsoon, causing the average temperatures in these two
					months to be lower compared to drier May and June. During the monsoon, there are frequent, heavy rains and thunderstorms, but flooding is not
					common. The highest temperature ever recorded was 48.5 °C (119.3 °F), in May. The city's average temperature remains below 20 °C or 68 °F
					between December and February. These months are mild, dry, and pleasant, sometimes chilly. The lowest temperature ever recorded was -2.2 °C
					(28.0 °F). Jaipur, like many other major cities of the world, is a significant urban heat island zone with surrounding rural temperatures occasionally
					falling below freezing in winters.
