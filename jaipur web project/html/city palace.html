				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
					City Palace has stood at the heart of the Old City of Jaipur for nearly three centuries, 
					shortly after Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II decided to relocate his court from the city of Amber. 
					Protected by huge guard walls, the fairy-tale-like structure is still the home of Jaipur's modern-day royal family,
					 and is more extravagant and enchanting than you might imagine
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					City Palace is more than a sand-colored regal abode—it's a sprawling complex of buildings built around
					 a series of landscaped garden courtyards overlooking Jaipur and Lake Palace. 
					The entire property is a stunning display of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture.

				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The current occupants reside in the most eye-catching building, the Chandra Mahal, an elegant structure with curved eaves and domed rooftops.
					 Each of its seven stories features an entirely different style. 
					 The ground floor is included in the price of admission, but you'll need to book a private tour to go upstairs.

				<h3>Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					The series of palaces in the city palace complex, behind an exquisite facade of 244 metres (801 ft) length and 30.4 metres (100 ft) height,
					 were built on a ridge on the east of lake Pichola. The complex is located in Udaipur city at 24.576°N 73.68°E, 
					 which is set with an average elevation of 598 metres (1,962 ft).[13] They were built over a long period, from 1559 onwards,
					  by 22 generations of Sisodia Rajputs. Several Maharanas starting with Udai Singh II, have contributed to this edifice,
					   which comprises an agglomeration of structures, including 11 small separate palaces.
					    The unique aspect of this conglomeration is that the architectural design is distinctly homogeneous. The palace complex has been built entirely in granite and marble.
						 The interiors of the palace complex with its balconies, towers and cupolas exhibit delicate mirror-work, marble-work, murals, wall paintings,
						  silver-work, inlay-work and leftover of colored glass.
