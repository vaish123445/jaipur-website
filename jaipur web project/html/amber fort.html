				<h2>history</h2>
				<p>
					Jaipur is home to one of India's most-visited forts: Amber Fort. Built in the year 1592, 
					the sandstone and marble monolith stands atop a small hill roughly 20 minute's driving distance northeast of the center of Jaipur. 
					It's best known for being a pristine example of Rajasthani architecture.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Getting to Amber Fort typically involves a short uphill hike that's well worth the effort.
		           	It's decked out with intricate patterns of inlaid marble in nearly every color of the rainbow. 
			        The fort is laid out into four separate sections, each of which has a spectacular garden courtyard outside.
					 While you'd never know it from above, you can actually explore the fort's underground tunnels, some of which have been restored.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					This UNESCO World Heritage Site has a fascinating history of legends, betrayals,
					 and romanceâ€”but the best way for tourists to hear these stories is to hire a private guide at the Amber Fort.

				<h2>GEOGRAPHY</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					Amber Palace is situated on a forested hill promontory that juts into Maota Lake near the town of Amber, about 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur city, 
					the capital of Rajasthan. 
					The palace is near National Highway 11C to Delhi.[20] A narrow 4WD road leads up to the entrance gate, known as the Suraj Pol (Sun Gate) of the fort.
					 It is now considered much more ethical for tourists to take jeep rides up to the fort, instead of riding the elephants..
				</p>

				<h2>Early History</h2>
				<br />
				<h3></h3>
				<p>
					The town of Amber and the Amber Fort was built by Raja Alan Singh Chanda belonging to a sub clan of Meenas in 967 AD, 
					later ruled by Kachwahas.[21] The Amber Fort, as it stands now, was erected over the remnants of this earlier structure during the reign of Raja Man Singh, 
					the Kachwaha King of Amber.[20][22] The structure was fully expanded by his descendant, Jai Singh I. Even later, 
					Amber Fort underwent improvements and additions by successive rulers over the next 150 years, 
					until the Kachwahas shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai Jai Singh II, in 1727.
