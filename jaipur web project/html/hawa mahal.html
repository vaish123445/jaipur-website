				<h2></h2>
				<p>
					If you had any preconceived notions about how the buildings in Jaipur look, they probably came from Hawa Mahal (Palace of Breeze).
					 It has all of the distinctive architectural features that appear in postcards of the city, from the salmon-pink, honeycombed facade,
					  built to resemble the crown of Hindu god Krishna, to the geometric accents and rows of tiny windows.
					  The landmark was built in 1799 to allow royal ladies to watch festivals on the street without being seen by the public.
					  Its 953 windows allow plenty of breeze to pass through, making it an ideal summer palace
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Tourists can learn about the history of the sandstone structure at the palace's small museumâ€”the ceremonial armor collection is particularly interesting.
					 You can also wander the narrow hallways that run throughout the palace. Don't miss the colorful glasswork in windows and doorways,
					  which cast an otherworldly glow on chambers throughout Hawal Mahal.

				<h2>Major Features</h2>
				<br />
				<h3>Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					Hawa Mahal, designed as a beehive castle with small windows, has a height of 50 feet from its base. This structure, 
					erected on a thin shield or podium approximately fifty feet high,
					 has walls less than a foot thick. Constructed of red and pink sandstones by Lal Chand Ustad, 
					Hawa Mahal is famous for its windows or 'Jharokhas' which enable free circulation of air within the structure.
					 Its entrance is a door which leads to a spacious courtyard surrounded by two-storey buildings on three sides. 
					 Of the five storeys of the Mahal, the top three storeys have the thickness of a single room while the bottom storeys have courtyards. 
				</p>

				<br />
				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>
					It was in 1799 that the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler, Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh who built Jaipur, 
					constructed Hawa Mahal as a continuation of the Royal City Palace. 
					Sawai Pratap Singh's devotion to Lord Krishna is evident in the palace's construction as it resembles the lord's crown. 
					Though many reasons are cited behind the construction of the fort, Purdah system followed by the Rajputs is said to be one of the main causes.
